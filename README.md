# Introduction
Welcome to the Python Challenge! In this project, I completed two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. These challenges involved analyzing financial records and poll data using Python scripting.

# Project Overview
In this project, I used Python scripting to automate the analysis of financial records and poll data. For PyBank, the goal was to analyze the financial records of a company and calculate various values, including the total number of months, net total amount of profits/losses, changes in profits/losses, and greatest increase/decrease in profits. For PyPoll, the goal was to modernize a rural town's vote-counting process by analyzing poll data and calculating the total number of votes cast, list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

# What I Did
In this project, I performed the following tasks:

* Created a Python script to analyze financial records and poll data
* Calculated the total number of months and net total amount of profits/losses in PyBank
* Calculated changes in profits/losses over the entire period and their average in PyBank
* Determined the greatest increase/decrease in profits and their respective dates in PyBank
* Calculated the total number of votes cast, list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote in PyPoll.

# Tools Used
The following tools were used in this project:

* Python - for scripting and data analysis
* Jupyter Notebook - for writing and executing the Python code
* Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis
* GitHub - for version control and collaboration
* VSCode - for writing and editing markdown files.

# What I Learned
Through this project, I gained experience in the following:

* Python scripting and automation
* Data analysis and manipulation using Pandas
* Calculating basic statistics and identifying trends in financial and poll data
* Collaborating on GitHub and using VSCode for writing and editing markdown files.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the Python Challenge allowed me to gain hands-on experience in automating the analysis of financial and poll data using Python scripting. I was able to calculate various values for both PyBank and PyPoll, including net total amount of profits/losses, percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. This project also helped me develop my skills in data manipulation, basic statistics, and collaborating on GitHub.
